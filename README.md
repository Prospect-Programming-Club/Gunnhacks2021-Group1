OneMessage

In this messaging app, you only get one message.

---

Every user is only allowed to construct one message of their own. After that, they exchange messages with every person they come across. The user can then keep track of how far their message went via a map.

---

The frontend uses a React Web App, accessible at https://prospect-programming-club.github.io/Gunnhacks2021-Group1. To use the website, simply enter a message, and wait for another to come your way. You can then pass this one on, and all users remain anonymous.

The backend uses a Express.JS Parse Server hosted on Heroku and a MongoDB Atlas database. The messages are stored in the database and are passed between the client and the server via web requests.
